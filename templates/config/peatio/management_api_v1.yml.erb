# Keep all the API security scopes.
#
# The API security scope consists of scope name, list of permitted and mandatory signers.
# The scope name is associated with API actions. For example, write_deposits is associated with
# ability to create deposits and accept them. The scopes which have «write» in the name are supposed
# to be dangerous so they must require more signers then read-only scopes
#
